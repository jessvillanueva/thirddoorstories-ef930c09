            Third Door Stories is an independent documentary series about unconventional builders — 
            the ones who found microgrants, residencies, hacker houses, and programs that changed 
            the trajectory of their lives.

            We believe the most interesting stories in tech and culture aren't happening at the 
            well-known companies or on the expected paths. They're happening in dorm rooms, coffee 
            shops, and Slack channels that most people will never find.

          <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-6 body-base text-foreground/[0.65]">
            <p>
              Every year, thousands of ambitious people miss opportunities that could change their 
              lives — not because they aren't qualified, but because they never heard about them. 
              The information asymmetry around unconventional paths is staggering.
            </p>
            <p>
              Third Door Stories exists to close that gap. We find the people who took these paths, 
              sit down with them, and turn their stories into documentaries that anyone can watch.
